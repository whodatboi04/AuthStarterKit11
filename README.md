### Step 6: Test the Authentication Endpoints
You can use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test your authentication endpoints.

1. **Register a User** by sending a POST request to /api/auth/register with name, email, password, and password_confirmation in the request body.

2. **Login a User** by sending a POST request to /api/auth/login with email and password. If successful, youâ€™ll receive a JWT token.

3. **Logout a User** by sending a GET request to /api/auth/logout with the Authorization header set to Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN.

# Conclusion
You now have a working JWT-based authentication system in your Laravel 11 project using tymon/jwt-auth. This basic setup will allow you to authenticate users and issue JWT tokens for API access.
